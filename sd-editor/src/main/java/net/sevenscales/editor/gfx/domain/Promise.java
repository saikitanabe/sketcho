/**
 * <p>
 * The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting
 * value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A promise is in one of three different states:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>pending - The initial state of a promise.</li>
 * <li>fulfilled - The state of a promise representing a successful operation.</li>
 * <li>rejected - The state of a promise representing a failed operation.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, it is immutable (i.e. it can never change again).
