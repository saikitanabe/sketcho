    <subsection name="Checking Out from Subversion (SVN)">

    <p>This project uses <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> as project manager
	and build tool.	We recommend you to install Maven 2.0.5 or greater before trying
	the following.</p><p>To checkout Acegi Security from SVN, see our
    <a href="cvs-usage.html">SVN Usage</a> page.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Quick Build"><p>Often people reading this document just want to see if Acegi Security will work
	for their projects. They want to deploy a sample application, and that's about it
	(after all, all the reference documentation can be read online at
	<a href="http://acegisecurity.org">http://acegisecurity.org</a>).
	In this case, execute:</p>
    <ol>
	<pre>cd $ACEGI_SECURITY/core (or cd %ACEGI_SECURITY%/core on Windows)</pre>
	<pre>mvn install</pre>
	<pre>cd $ACEGI_SECURITY/samples/contacts</pre>
	<pre>mvn package</pre>
    <pre>mvn jetty:run</pre>
    </ol>

    <p>This should build main framework library, build the sample application and run the "contacts" sample application
       using the maven jetty plugin (JDK 1.5 or later is required to run the Jetty plugin).
       You should then be able to point your browser at
       <a href="http://localhost:8080/contacts/">http://localhost:8080/contacts/</a> to use the application.
    </p>
