  <strong>acegi-security-xx.zip</strong> file, which contains all of the officially
  released JARs, a copy of all documentation, and two WAR artifacts. The two WAR artifacts
  are from the Contacts Sample and the Tutorial Sample application. The Tutorial Sample
  consists of a "bare bones" configuration that will get you up and running quickly, whereas
  the Contacts Sample illustrates more advanced features.</p>

  <p>The acegi-security-xx-src.zip is intended for use with IDEs. It does not contain the
  files needed to compile Acegi Security. It also does not contain the sources to the
  sample applications. If you need any of these files, please download from SVN.</p><subsection name="Official Releases"><p>The official release ZIP files are available from the
