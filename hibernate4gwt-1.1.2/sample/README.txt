WARNING
-------

The main goal of TestApplication is to test hibernate4gwt. 
It is NOT a typical hibernate4gwt application, because it has to manage the three supported configurations (stateful, stateless and Java5 support) with the same code. Consequently, I had to develop some tricky code to enable support of different Domain class with the same purpose (User and Message).
Furthermore, the core functionality of the client side is not finished yet, and will be achieved in near future...
